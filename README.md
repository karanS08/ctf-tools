# Special Note 
```py
'''
always make more then 4 pull request
lets say you have made only 4 pull request to different projects
but if one project is excluded from hackoctoberfest event then your pull request will not be counted and 
then you have only 3 remaining valid pull request if these projects are not excluded.
if you fail to make 4 pull request then you can't get swags or t-shirts.
